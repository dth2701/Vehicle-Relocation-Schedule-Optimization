    "<b/> Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a challenge for car rental companies to match the vehicle supply with order demand in all the locations. This is due to the low transportability of inventory in the industry. The cost of relocating vehicles from other locations for meeting the demand of a certain location, especially when the locations are far from long distance, could be even higher than the potential profit. Therefore, maximizing the service rate while not hurting the revenue becomes a significant business target in the car rental industry.\n",
    "In this project,we mainly focus on the car relocation schedule between five locations of Zipcar in the Chicago area. We intend to perform an analysis to find the optimal relocation schedules benefiting their business performance. The five locations we choose are in the same region and not far from each other because we need to satisfy the premise that relocation cost is lower than the potential profit. The demand data was from a member’s project last semester(Tian,2022). The data was estimated based on research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze three different cases in this project. In the first case, we assume that all customers will return vehicles to the original location after use, while in the second case we assume the vehicles will be returned to random locations instead. We intend to compare the business results between the two cases to see the impact from the supply variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third case, we make a new assumption that there are third-party companies nearby supporting our company when backorders happen. We can rent more vehicles from the third-party company at some cost when the car inventory of our locations is in shortage.  We initially assume outsourcing from third parties will reduce our profit due to the high cost. In this case, the rental strategy with third-party companies would also be a variable in the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is a vehicle sharing problem. There are 5 stations in this city {A, B, C, D, E}, with each station having an amount of vehicles available. The demand in each station is randomly distributed, but we simplified the demand to some constants in this optimization problem. The example demand for each station is shown in the time schedule. Initially, each station has 30 vehicles at 0:00, which means there are 150 vehicles in total. From 0:00 to 23:00, the company can relocate any number of vehicles from one station to another in order to better satisfy customer demand. The relocation cost is based on the distance between stations. In the Figure1 for example, the relocation cost from A to B would be higher than A to E due to the longer distance. The distance would also make the travel time and return time different for each customer, which would influence the station inventory. Every time we successfully serve a customer, the company would gain profits based on their distance. If a customer arrives but there is no vehicle available, a backorder incurs with a penalty cost of 100 . The objective of this optimization problem is to satisfy the maximum number of customers and to maximize the total profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better visualize the network flow in this problem, we use figure 1 to interpret the relationship and the distance between each station. We consider station E as a center station. If there is one single line between two stations, for example A to E, the distance is 1. If the travel crosses one city, for example A to D, the distance will be 2. The revenue for one distance is 80, and the relocation cost for one distance is 30.\n"

    "* The change of demand can increase both the profits and service rate in the second case. The returned vehicles can be used as a part of relocation source for another station, so if the fluctuations of demand at each station are differet,  profits and service rate will be increased by allowing customer to return the vehicles to other stations. In the demand matrix, the demand in station A in the morning is significantly high, and the demand in station B in the afternoon is high. The customers driven from station A would return their cars at station B, and the arrived vehicles at station B can be sources for customers with no relocation needs. \n",

    "* When outsourcing more vehicles from third-party suppliers, the service rate can be improved at the trade-off of total profits decreases due to the high cost. In our assumption, the daily rental cost is 1000 per vehicle. We set up a tradeoff parameter to balance the weight between profits and service rate for the purpose of maximizing business performance. Higher value of tradeoff parameter will make the service rate weights more in the objective function than profits, and vice versa. \n",

    "In the result, we are expected to relocate one vehicle from one station to another. The number of cars been relocated is not many, but the profits and service rate can still be improved. We also make a summarized plot to show the backorders (Figure 3). The overall distribution of backorder among different stations distributes smoothly, but there are peaks in backorder during the morning and evening. For example, the demand at station E in the morning is higher, so we can relocate vehicles from other stations to station E; and the demand at station E drops in the evening, and we can relocate vehicles from station E to other stations as well."

    "As we discussed previously, there is a trade-off between profits and service rate. In case 2, the trade-off can be determined by the number of vehicles we relocate. When we relocate more vehicles, the relocation fee reduces more profit,but will increases service rate. However, the trade-off will be ignored when penalty cost is taken into consideration. This is becasue the penalty cost from losing customer is always the most, so our target in the senario would always be maximizing service rate  no matter how much weight (tradeoff parameter) we set in the objective function (figure 5).\n",

    "In case 3, the rental cost from the third-party supplier is introduced, which can compensate the effect of penalty cost. In this case, when we rent more vehicles from the supplier, the total profits would drop since the rental cost is higher than the penalty cost. At the same time, the service rate would increase since there are more vehicles available in our system (Table 4). In the following figure (Figure 6), two curves show the trade-off between the profits and service rate. By using the previous $\\lambda$ value, we can get 50k in profits and 0.8 service rate. If we want to gain more customer satisfaction and service rate, trade-off parameter can be set to larger scale. For example, when the $\\lambda$ changes to $10^3$, we can get 100% service rate, with 23k profits as compensation.\n",

    "In the previous section, we made an assumption that the daily rental cost from supplier is 1000. In reality, we can find the acceptable price by given service rate. The relationship between the acceptable price and service rate can be interpreted in the following figure (Figure 7). For example, when we want to reach around 0.9 in service rate, we need to rent 20 vehicles. If we are renting 20 vehicles, the acceptable rental price from supplier would be around 840 such that we can maintain the same profits as we made in case two. Obviously, the higher service rate we want to get, the lower offer we can give to the supplier. In reality, the price from the supplier is not negotiable, so the company can use this analysis to find the decision. On the other hand, we always want to sacrifice some profits to gain more service rate. "

    "Based on the analysis all above, we conclude that relocation is a viable way to improve the business result of Zipcar. However, backorders still exist even after relocating, indicating that Zipcar needs to add more cars into the operation. On the other hand, outsourcing has proved that the service rate will be increased indeed, but the profit will be reduced as the trade-off. Therefore, we have two recommendations for Zipcar： Investing more vehicles and negotiating with third-party companies for lower cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first suggestion is that Zipcar consider adding more cars into the operation for the five locations. As we can see from the figure 3 that all five locations have backorders in case 1 and case 2. Plus, It is reflected from table 3 that the vehicles available for relocating are very little, which means the total number of cars  in the system need to be increased to meet the demand. However, the challenge in this scenario is that Zipcar will need to have a reliable demand forecasting system. An accurate forecasting data will help Zipcar to add the optimal amount of vehicles that will maximize service rate while avoiding inventory overstock. Besides, the timeline of the data we analyzed is only one day. So Zipcar also needs to consider the demand fluctuation from seasonality before making the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second suggestion we have is negotiating the outsource cost with third party companies. As we can see from the figure 4 that the strategy of outsourcing can remarkably reduce the amount of backorders. The advantage of outsourcing over the first recommendation is that it provides Zipcar with flexibility. Zipcar can easily adjust the number of vehicles in their operation as the demand changes, and do not need to consider the overstock issue during slack season. However, we have the assumption that the cost of outsourcing is higher than the profit, so there is a trade-off for Zipcar to make between service rate and revenue. Therefore, Zipcar may consider negotiating the outsource cost with the third party in order to achieve a  long-term strategic partnership that mutually benefits both parties. Under the partnership, Zipcar will be able to improve the operation without sacrificing revenue, while the third party will receive more orders and business possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result from our model has proved the feasibility of the methods, and we believe the report will benefit the business performance of Zipcar, especially if our recommendations can be implemented.\n"
