    "**The issue we are addressing is the car relocation schedule for several locations of a car rental company. We aim to find the schedule that optimizes their business performance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem is a vehicle sharing problem. There are 5 stations in this city {A, B, C, D, E}, with each station has some vehicles available. The demand in each station is randomly distributed, but we simplified the demand to some constants in this optimization problem. The example demand for each station is shown in the time schedule. Initially, each station has 30 vehicles at 0:00, which means there are 150 vehicles in total. From 0:00 to 23:00, the company can relocate any number of vehicles from one station to another in order to better satisfy customer demand. The relocation cost is based on the distance between stations. In the Figure 1 below for example, the relocation cost from A to B would be higher than A to E due to the longer distance. The distance would also make the travel time and return time different for each customer, which would influence the station inventory. Every time we successfully serve a customer, the company would gain profits based on their distance. If a customer arrives but there is no vehicle available, a backorder incurs with a penalty cost of 150 . The objective of this optimization problem is to satisfy the maximum number of customers and maximize the total profits.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**To better visualize the network flow in this problem, we use a simple network chart to interpret the relationship and the distance between each station in Figure 1. In this problem, we consider station E as a center station. If there is one single line between two stations, for example A to E, the distance is 1. If the travel crosses one city, for example A to D, the distance will be 2. The revenue for one distance is 50, and the relocation cost for one distance is 30.**\n"

    "**In reality, the actual situations could be more complicated, so we make two assumptions. The first one is that certain routes will be closed because of traffic control. To better satisfy the customersâ€™ demand, we would relocate more vehicles before that control happens. The second assumption is that there are third-party companies nearby supporting our company when backorders happen. We can rent more vehicles from the third-party company at some cost when the car inventory of our locations is in shortage. As a result, the rental strategy from a third-party company would also be a variable in the optimization problem.** "
